    <p>Classic cars are automotive treasures, typically 20-30 years old or older, celebrated for their historical significance, unique designs, and cultural impact. They often represent the pinnacle of engineering and aesthetics from their eras, such as the elegant lines of the Ford Model T or the sporty curves of the Chevrolet Corvette. These vehicles are rare and highly collectible, cherished by enthusiasts who restore and maintain them as symbols of a bygone era. Classic cars not only serve as a testament to the advancements in automotive technology but also evoke nostalgia and admiration for the craftsmanship of the past.</p>
